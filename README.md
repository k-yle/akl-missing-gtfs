# Auckland Missing GTFS

The [official GTFS Feed for Auckland, NZ](https://at.govt.nz/about-us/at-data-sources/general-transit-feed-specification/) does not contain data for some private operators.

This repository contains a GTFS feed, which contains routes missing from the official feed.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The timetables in this feed are not intended to be accurate, and should NOT be used for navigation. Timetables are approximate, and intended solely for research and analysis, where approximate timings will suffice.

To download the data, [use this link to `gtfs.zip`](https://github.com/k-yle/akl-missing-gtfs/raw/main/gtfs.zip). To view or edit the data, see the [gtfs](./gtfs) folder.
